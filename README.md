Use at least two min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for larger screens.

Git requirements:
Whole team: A shared team Git repository with frequent commits from each team member and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes.
Each team member: An individual Git repository with feature branches, frequent commits, and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make, including experimental work that you ultimately might not push upstream to the shared group repository.
All GitHub repositories (team and individual) must contain only the files and commits from this project.
